# Durable Settings Manager

The durable settings manager ensures that a toml file exists in the file system, and that it has a set of minimum keys.

This file looks a bit like this:

```toml
# this file is automatically generated and edited by mercurialftc's scheduler
# you may add more settings here and they will show up in the 'Edit Scheduler Config Options' OpMode that appears under the teleop list
# removing either of these two properties will cause the scheduler to remake this file with the default settings

schedulerRefreshEnabled = true
loggingEnabled = true
```

These settings can be managed using the Teleop OpMode named "Edit Scheduler Config Options" which will appear on your robot while this library is installed.

Edits made to these settings are durable, which means they will persist through a reboot.

These settings can be edited programmatically too:

```java
// we do NOT want to refresh the scheduler when we swap to teleop
Scheduler.getConfigOptionsManager().updateValue(Scheduler.ConfigOptions.SCHEDULER_REFRESH_ENABLED.getOption(), false);

try {
   Scheduler.getConfigOptionsManager().update(); // actually updates the setting we changed
} catch (IOException e) {
   throw new RuntimeException(e);
}
```
