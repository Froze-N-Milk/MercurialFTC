# Contact and Contribution

## Contributing

I am more than happy for people interested in contributing to make PRs into the repository, if you're interested in doing so, but feel a bit lost, feel free to reach out to me, and I'd be happy to help you with selecting something for you to attempt to change or improve.

## Contact

I can be contacted on the Unofficial FIRST Tech Challenge discord server, or through the MercurialFTC discord server ([https://discord.gg/xaSHyhKkFr](https://discord.gg/xaSHyhKkFr)).

If you are a student I do not accept DMs through discord, additionally, if you are having issues with a problem, someone else may be having the same issue, or may be able to help you in a more timely fashion than me.

Alternatively, I can be contacted through this email: [oscar.chevalier@pymblelc.nsw.edu.au](mailto:oscar.chevalier@pymblelc.nsw.edu.au)

Note that this email is monitored by an educational body at which I teach.

## Thanks

Additionally, I'd like to thank the students at Pymble who started using this while I was still writing it, you've certainly shaped the way it came out in some manner, and sorry for the pain i put you through.

Also thanks to those who expressed interest in trying mercurial before it was finished, and kept me extra driven to get it out in an even slightly timely fashion.
