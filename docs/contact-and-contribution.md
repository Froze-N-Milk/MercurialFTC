# Contact and Contribution

## Contributing

I am more than happy for people interested in contributing to make PRs into the repository. If you're interested in doing so, but feel a bit lost, feel free to reach out to me, and I'll be happy to help you with selecting an area for you to attempt to change or improve.

## Contact

I can be contacted on the Unofficial FIRST Tech Challenge discord server, or through the MercurialFTC discord server: [https://discord.gg/xaSHyhKkFr](https://discord.gg/xaSHyhKkFr).

If you are a student, I do not accept DMs through discord. Furthermore, if you are having issues with a problem, someone else may be having the same issue, or may be able to help you in a more timely fashion than me.

Alternatively, I can be contacted through this email: [oscar.chevalier@pymblelc.nsw.edu.au](mailto:oscar.chevalier@pymblelc.nsw.edu.au)

Please note that this email is monitored by an educational body at which I teach.

## Thanks

Additionally, I'd like to thank the students at Pymble who started using this while I was still writing it. You've certainly shaped the way it came out in some manner, and sorry for the pain I put you through :)

Also thanks to those who expressed interest in trying mercurial before it was finished, and kept me extra driven to get it out in an even, slightly timely fashion.
